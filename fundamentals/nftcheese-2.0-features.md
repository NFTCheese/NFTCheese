## 1. **Multiple rarity sources**

Every software has slight differences in the way they calculate the rarity ranking score. You now can choose the ranking source to your preference other than the default NFTCheese's rarity ranking.

Here are the prioritized sources:

1. Traitsniper
2. Raritymon
3. Raritysniper

## 2. Listing distribution, sorted by price or rank

Ever wonder how the market list the NFTs? You can now stop guessing by looking at this chart that shows how many NFTs have been listed at each price group.

Have difficulties in pricing your rare NFT correctly? With this chart, you avoid listing your NFT at a high price that nobody will buy or missing the potential profit if listing at a low price.

## 4. View event history of a single NFT asset

"Does this NFT get a lot of demand? Is the owner of this NFT a paper or diamond hand? Is the owner trying hard to get rid of this NFT?"

You don't have to go else where to do homework for these questions any more.

Just by clicking the NFT info button, the answers unfold in the event history chart.

This popup is easily accessible in the sniping window and normal opensea item view.

## 5. Check the traits' rarity at your fingertip
