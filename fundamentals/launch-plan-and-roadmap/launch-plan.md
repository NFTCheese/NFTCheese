# Launch Plan

Our team is working on NFTCheese 2.0 at the moment and will release completed features as we go.

All of the features after releasing can be used for free for the time being so that we can collect as much feedback as possible.

### Winter 2022...

is the estimate launch time of NFTCheese 2.0. There will be a new NFT pass collection. After launch, NFTCheese 2.0 is restricted to only the pass holders of this collection.

#### What about the NFTCheese Genesis Pass holders?

The NFTCheese Genesis Pass holders will get to mint the new NFT for FREE as this is an exclusive perk of being the early supporter of NFTCheese. This applies for the next NFT collection or any NFT collection we plan to release in the future.

### Transparent development

Our team will keep the community updated with each of the features' development.

Not only that, the community, pass holder specifically, can request features to be added to NFTCheese. Read more about **Feature Requests** :point\_down:below
