Every softwares has little difference in the way they calculate the rarity ranking score.&#x20;

You now can choose the ranking source to your preference other than the default NFTCheese's rarity ranking.

Here are the prioritized sources:

1. Traitsniper
2. Raritymon
3. Raritysniper

## 2. Listing distributes, sorted by price or rank

Ever wonder how the market list the NFTs? Are you listing your NFT too cheap or too expensive?

You can now stop guessing by looking at this chart.

What about ranking? What are the prices at a certain ranking range?

With this chart, you avoid listing your NFT at a high price which no body will buy or missing the potential profit if listing at a low price.

"Does this NFT get a lot of demand? Is the owner of this NFT a paper or diamond hand? Is the owner trying hard to get rid of this NFT?"

You don't have to go else where to do homework for these questions any more.

Just by clicking the NFT info button, the answers unfold in the event history chart.
