### Features:

<details>

<summary>Filter by rank</summary>

Snipe top rank NFTs on the floor or during reveal before others. Or use this to see analytics of a certain ranking range to your advantage.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Listing notifications</summary>

You can set alarm to scoop out the NFTs instantly when they are being listed at a certain rarity or with certain traits.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Filter by favorite or rare traits</summary>

Not only you can view all available NFTs of your favorite traits, you can also see which ones are rare, along with sale & listing data belong to those traits.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Instant reveal</summary>

Opensea sucks when it comes to showing images during review. NFTCheese allows you to view the NFTs' images directly from smart contract source at the time of reveal.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Mass image refresh</summary>

Like instant reveal, but imagine doing it for all NFTs on the page in a single button click.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Sale activity charts</summary>

Study about the NFTs before you buy them: Average price, daily volume traded.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Rarity Rank</summary>

Why buying generic NFTs at the floor while you can buy rare NFTs at the floor (or close it it). Filter within a rarity ranking range and spot the underpriced NFTs.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Live gas fee when trade</summary>

So that you can avoid over spending on gas.
